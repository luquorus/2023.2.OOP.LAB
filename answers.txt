The class that should implement the Comparable interface is the Media class. This is because the Comparable interface is used to compare an object of the same class with an instance of that class

In the Media class,implement the compareTo() method to reflect the ordering that want. The compareTo() method should return a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer if the "this" object is less than, equal to, or greater than the object passed as an argument.

The Comparable interface in Java allows you to define a single natural ordering for a class. This is because an object can have at most one natural order.
If want to have two different ordering rules (for example, by title then cost and by cost then title),use the Comparator interface. The Comparator interface allows for multiple different comparison strategies detached from the objects are sorting.


@Override
public int compareTo(Media other) {
  if (this instanceof DVD) {
      int titleComparison = this.title.compareTo(other.title);
      if (titleComparison != 0) {
          return titleComparison;
      }
      int lengthComparison = Integer.compare(other.length, this.length);
      if (lengthComparison != 0) {
          return lengthComparison;
      }
      return Double.compare(this.cost, other.cost);
  } else {
      // Implement other media types comparison
  }
}
